    <h1>Charred Salsa Verde</h1>

    <p>This is a recipe that I blatantly stole from <a href="http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/">J. Kenji López-Alt</a>. It's super simple and quick! Give it a try if you like tangy salsa.</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p><ui>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds tomatillos, husks removed, split in half (680g; about 10 medium)</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, peeled and split in half (about 6 ounces; 170g)</li>
        <li>2 to 4 Serrano or jalapeño chiles (adjust according to spice tolerance, remove seeds and ribs for milder spice), split in half</li>
        <li>10 to 15 sprigs cilantro, tough lower stems discarded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ui></p>
    <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Cut everything up.</li>
        <li>Throw it on a rack (<em>pls don't char the cilantro</em>).</li>
        <li>Broil everything until its <strong>charred</strong>.</li>
        <li>Blend it until a rough puree is formed. I like to reserve a few tomatillos and add them after blending the onion and peppers so the strong flavors are distributed while the overall consistancy isn't thin. </li>
        <li>Pour salsa into a screaming hot pan. Immediately remove from heat, and stir for approximately 3 min. This thickens the consistancy and adds a second layer of smokiness.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and let cool.</li>
    </ol></p>
